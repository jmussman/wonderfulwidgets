	<h1>Welcome to The Wonderful Widget Company!</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>This site is designed as an example of HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and jQuery.
        The TypeScript is compiled and bundled using WebPack.
        You may notice that jQuery is left out of the bundle so that it can be loaded and used from HTML script tags, as they won't "import" it.
        This is purposely not a framework example, e.g. Angular, Vue, or React, to demonstrate a non-single-page-application using these technologies.</p>
    <h2>Source</h2>
    <p>The source to the site is at <a href="https://github.com/jmussman/wonderfulwidgets" target="blank">https://github.com/jmussman/wonderfulwidgets</a>, and
        is released for public and private use under the MIT license.</p>
    <h2>Local Login</h2>
    <p>Click on the login link to get to the local login, the purpose of which is to provide a platform for demonstrating a login for password managers, etc.
        On authentication the local login moves to a logged-in state.
        It authenticates any user name and password as valid (no user database), with the exception of any username that begins with "badguy".
        In the logged in state the <i>gravatar</i> dropdown has a "logout" menu item to click to log out.</p>
    <p>Use this link to the login page: https://wonderfulwidgets.com/login.html, and this <a href="assets/images/application-logo.png" target="blank">application logo</a> to configure
        identity providers such as Okta to link to wonderfulwidgets.com as a password-managed application.</p>
    <h2>Gravatar</h2>
    <p>When authenticated the menu displays the gravatar (<a href="https://gravatar.com" target="blank">https://gravatar.com</a>) for the username.
        If the username is not registered at gravatar.com a default icon is displayed.
        The gravatar is selected programmatically in the MenuBuilder module (src/modules/MenuBuilder.ts). </p>
