	<h1>Vision Statement</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/user-story.png" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 20px; float: right;" />
    <p>A vision statement is normally a separate project document that defines the goals and purpose of an application.
        The vision statement is used in conjunction with use cases and/or user stories to identify all of the requirements for the application.
        The statement for this project is simple, and is included here to demonstrate some of the work that goes on behind the project.</p>
    <h2>Statement</h2>
    <p>The Wonderful Widget Company and wonderfulwidgets.com will reserve the example company name and Internet domain name so that course developers who choose
        to use them in code examples, course material, and development labs can rest assured that they are not encroaching on a name used commercially.
        The intention is that anyone choosing to develop course materials will be able to reference the example name and website,
        with the stipulation that they only be used strictly for legal, ethical, and morally upright purposes: see the <a href="license.html">license page</a>.</p>
    <p>The project goals are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reserve the name for anyone to use in code examples, course material, and development labs.</li>
        <li>Provide an example of a simple multi-page web application with client-side code. Modern single-page-application frameworks like Angular and React are intentionally not used for this example.</li>
        <li>Provide a platform with widgets that examples and labs may use. These widgets are independent of each other and function in a multi-page site.</li>        
    </ol>
