	<p>When I was a wee lad I remember writing many programming examples where we used <id>The Wonderful Widget Company</id> as our foundation.
		Well, less than ten years later I was at the Air Force's Rome Air Development Center helping make the ArpaNET successful, spinning the Internet off, and then the World Wide Web came along.
		I had the luck to register <i>wonderfulwidgets.com</i> before somebody else did!
		For decades I have held onto the name so that you and anybody else can reference the example company name and the domain name for examples and classes
		and be confident they are not stepping on somebody else.</p>
	<p>Occasionally I add things to the site that I want to leave around to use periodically, and you are welcome to use them too: see the <a href="widgets.html">widgets page</a>.
		There is a application-local login page that accepts almost any username and password (there is no user database, everyone is authenticated).
		I use it frequently in demonstrations to register an application in <a href="https://okta.com" target="blank">Okta</a> tenants
		as an example that uses "Secure Web Access", the fancy name for Okta's browser plugin that provides password management.
		Just to show it a login failure there is one username that will always be rejected: "badguy" :)</p>
	<p>Enjoy!</p>
