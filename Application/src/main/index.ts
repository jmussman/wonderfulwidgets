// index.ts fulfills two purposes: it is the entry point for the application, and sets up the page load callback
// that provides calls to the functions that build the common boilerplate for all pages, regardless of which page
// was loaded as long as the page references the bundle.
//
// The second purpose is to export the entry points for the code-behind-page modules as members of the "application"
// object (see the output in webpack.config.js) so that pages may reference their own code-behind from their script.
